Heuristic agent sort proof of concept. The idea: imagine each agent has an opinion about whether it is greater than its neighbor (say, funnier or more attactive, something that not everyone agrees on). This script demonstrates the idea using a numerical comparison but any comparator could work, and each agent could have its own distinct comparator logic.
